#RECURSION - Function Calling Itself.

When you write a recursive function, you have to tell it when to stop
recursing. That’s why every recursive function has two parts: the base
case, and the recursive case. The recursive case is when the function calls
itself. The base case is when the function doesn’t call itself again, so it
doesn’t go into an infinite loop.

Why Recursion?

-It helps us in solving bigger/complex problem in a simpler way.
-Space Complexity is not constant because of recursive call

How to approach a recursive problem?

- Identify problem and break it down into a smaller problem.
- Write the recursive relation, if needed.
- Draw the recursive tree.

Types of Recursion -

- Linear Recurrence Relation - Fibo
- Divide and Conquer relation - Binary Search
